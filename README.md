# MyArduinoProject
These Arduino projects introduce basic concepts like controlling LEDs, reading sensors (temperature, distance), and interacting with actuators (servo motor, buzzer, 7-segment display). They cover digital/analog inputs, PWM control, and simple user interactions, making them ideal for beginners.
